    <p class="quote">“The soprano <b>ABIGAIL RAIFORD,</b> in the often overlooked role of Lisa, was the
      standout on
      Sunday.
      Silvery and resonant,
      her voice could easily be heard above the chorus.”
      <br> <br>
      <i>- The New York Times</i>
    </p>

    <br><br>

    <p class="quote">“Soprano <b>ABIGAIL RAIFORD</b> sang with ravishing sonority and a beautiful sheen,
      offering proof
      that
      Bellini doesn’t always
      need to be sung softly and supplely.
      Raiford played the role as a spirited and petulant vamp, and was fun and flirty in her scenes with the mysterious
      Count
      Rodolfo.”

    <p class="quote">“When we think of La Sonnambula, we think of the famed final scene, which includes the two
      most
      famous arias of the
      piece. However, on this evening, it was Lisa’s character that seemed to receive the biggest ovation. In the role,
      <b>ABIGAIL RAIFORD</b> showcased a sweet and full lyric sound that also allowed for flexibility in coloratura. In
      her
      second
      aria, “De lieti auguri,” Raiford displayed clear trills and accurate roulade phrases in the opening of the aria.
      Then,
      as she repeated the main theme, Raiford interpolated numerous runs and high notes that were crystal clear but also
      playful and incredibly virtuosic. What is generally seen as a secondary character, turned into a showstopping
      moment
      following the aria.
      Raiford also displayed a lush legato line in her first aria, “Tutto è gioia” that opens the first act. Perhaps
      there
      were some intonation issues at the start, but as she settled into the musical phrases, her repetition was solid
      and
      showcased a mournful Lisa longing for Elvino. That was emphasized by her tasteful interpolations that never veered
      from
      Bellini’s musical line.
      Raiford was also solid in the choral moments, and her stage presence played into Lisa’s jealousy and her scheming
      nature.”

    <p class="quote">“The breakout star, however, was <b>ABIGAIL RAIFORD</b> as the flirty, scheming Lisa (who
      finds she
      can
      hate Amina, at least
      for a little while). Her voice is silvery, agile and full of attitude, as is her physical presence. Raiford has
      all the
      sass and sharpness in spades for any soubrette role. Despite Amina’s obvious goodness, I couldn’t help but root
      for her
      to win the day—not the jealous and fickle Elvino, but the Count, or even better, a ticket out of this adorable
      town—all
      a testament to Raiford’s vivacious charm. ”

    <p class="quote">“<b>ABIGAIL RAIFORD</b> offered a petulant, highly spirited portrayal of Lisa, the village
      innkeeper and
      rival to Amina. With
      her bright, firmly focused soprano, she sang her Act 2 ‘De lieti auguri’ with sparkling coloratura and ravishing
      sound.”

    <p class="quote">“As Lisa, <b>ABIGAIL RAIFORD</b> made the most of a secondary role, singing with precision
      and
      dramatic
      flair. La
      sonnambula gives the character limited opportunities, but Teatro Nuovo’s inclusion of her Act II aria allowed
      Raiford to
      display both technical assurance and stage presence. Her soprano was bright and well-focused, with a slight edge
      that
      suited the character’s jealousy and social ambition. With phrasing marked by bite and intention, Raiford brought
      comic
      timing and expressive clarity to Lisa’s increasingly frustrated maneuvers, making her more than just a foil to
      Amina. If
      Castillo projected stillness and sincerity, Raiford offered tension and energy – a vivid contrast that added shape
      and
      dynamism to the surrounding scenes. ”
