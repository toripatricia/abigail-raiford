    <p class="bio-text">Her training has taken her across the country and across the Atlantic.  During the 2022 season,
      she made a splash
      during
      her first season with Central City Opera as a Bonfils-Stanton Studio Artist.  In the same weekend, she learned and
      performed the role of Krysia in Heggie’s Two Remain with mere hours of preparation, and then stepped in as Ida
      in Die
      Fledermaus the following day.  She was given the Central City Opera Guild’s McGlone Award at the end of the

      Pinocchio.  In Europe, she spent a summer studying in the heart of Vienna, and later traveled to Rome to work
      intensively with the incomparable soprano Mariella Devia.  She also participated in SongFest’s Professional

    <p class="bio-text"> Outside of her work as a soloist, she has enjoyed opportunities to perform in a variety of
      professional ensembles.
       She
      recorded soundtracks for Ang Lee’s Gemini Man and Olivia Wilde’s Don’t Worry Darling, performed with Musica
      Sacra and
      the New York Philharmonic for their concert of Close Encounters of the Third Kind in David Geffen Hall,

      Spike.  She
      also sang the Knaben solo in the Bard Festival Chorale’s performance of Richard Strauss’ An den Baum Daphne at
      Carnegie
      Hall.  She currently maintains her position as the Soprano 1 section leader in the choir of The Church of the Holy
      Trinity on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. When she’s not singing, she loves taking walks along the New York City
      waterfront, working on puzzles, and playing video games, with her favorite games coming from the Fire Emblem,
      Persona and Pokémon series.  As a teenager, she was deeply influenced by the music of David Bowie, Tom Waits, the
      Dave
      Matthews Band, Ben Folds, and Lorde, and she continues to be inspired by their music today.  She is a proud sister
      of Sigma Alpha Iota, and has been an active member of the New York Alumnae Chapter since 2018.  Her most recent
      international trip took her to Tokyo, which captured her heart with its natural and architechtural beauty, culture
      and
      delicious food.
